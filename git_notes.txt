Git-init: This command creates an empty Git repository - basically a .git directory with subdirectories for objects , refs/heads , refs/tags , and template files.
Gitit-status: The git status command displays the state of the working directory and the staging area.
Git add : This command can be performed multiple times before a commit. It only adds the content of the specified file(s) at the time the add command is run.
Git commit: The git commit command captures a snapshot of the project's currently staged changes. Committed snapshots can be thought of as “safe” versions of a project.
